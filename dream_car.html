            Whenever talk turns to the legendary Toyota Supra, it's a good bet that the 1993-1998 Mk4 Supra is the car mentioned first. The combination of its Fast and Furious stardom and its powerful, over-engineered 2JZ engine made the Mk4 the king of the tuner world for decades. But when the Mk4's resale prices became untouchable for many, aspiring JDM hotrodders started to turn to the next best thing: the A70 Mk3 Toyota Supra.

            Introduced in 1986, the third-generation Mk3 marked the first time Toyota officially made the Supra its own model.

The A70 turned the Supra from an upgradable option package to a legitimate sports car. The following is a comprehensive list of everything you'd ever want to know about Toyota's other old school Supra.
