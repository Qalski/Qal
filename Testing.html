            <h4>Inspirational life quotes</h4>
            <br>
            <blockquote>

                "“When I was a young man, I had liberty, but I did not see it. I had time, but I did not know it. And I had love, but I did not feel it. Many decades would pass before I understood the meaning of all three. And now, the twilight of my life, this understanding has passed into contentment.

                
                
                Forever yours,
                Ezio Auditore.”"

            <blockquote>
                
                Love, liberty, and time: once so disposable, are the fuels that drive me forward. And love, most especially, mio caro. For you, our children, our brothers and sisters. And for the vast and wonderful world that gave us life, and keeps us guessing. Endless affection, mia Sofia.

            </blockquote>

                When Windah was in the [[eleventh grade]], he was frequently [[bullying|bullied]] by his [[Class (education)|classmates]], eventually leading him to quit school and work for his father as an [[internet café]] operator. His parents convinced him to continue his education to graduate with a [[diploma]], so he later applied for a [[homeschooling]] program run by [[:id:Seto Mulyadi|Kak Seto]],<ref name="blitsnews"/><ref name="Dunia Games">{{cite news |last=Syahdan |first=Oleh |date=13 January 2021 |title=[PROFILE] Getting to Know Windah Basudara's Brando, Pre-Teens' Favorite YouTuber |publisher=Dunia Games |agency=Telkomsel |url=https://duniagames.co.id/discover/article/profil-brando-windah-basudara/en |access-date=3 January 2022}}</ref> an Indonesian [[Psychologist]].
                
                After graduating from high school, Windah went to college where he studied [[International relations]] for a [[Bachelor's degree]] (Strata-1 in Indonesian academic standard) at [[:id:STIKOM The London School of Public Relations|The London School of Public Relations]] (LSPR), but he had to drop out due to economic constraints.<ref name="Kumparan"/><ref name="blitsnews"/><ref name="Dunia Games"/>
                
                In July 2022, his channel is hacked by a live streaming video showing an American businessman named [[Brad Garlinghouse]]<ref>https://www.tribunnewswiki.com/2022/07/16/kanal-youtubenya-diduga-kena-hack-windah-basudara-ingatkan-hal-ini-ke-subscriber</ref>
                
                After quitting college, Windah began his working life as a [[waiter]] in a small café in Jakarta, where he earned around [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]] 900,000 per month. He quit after only a month due to the low wage.<ref name="Dunia Games"/> Soon after, Windah started work at the Bluegrass restaurant in [[South Jakarta]], where he was trained to be more professional, so his communication skills improved rapidly.
                
                After three months at the Bluegrass, hotel officials from ''The Westin Jakarta Hotel'' visited the restaurant and Windah received an offer of work at the new [[five-star hotel]] due to open in the [[Gama Tower]]. Having decided to accept the offer, Windah quit his job at the restaurant.<ref name="Kumparan"/><ref name="blitsnews"/><ref name="Dunia Games"/> Because it was several months before ''The Westin Jakarta'' would open, he was unable to start immediately, so in the meantime, Windah had to find work in another restaurant.<ref name="blitsnews"/><ref name="Dunia Games"/>
                
                Once working at the hotel, Windah earned a salary of around IDR 10,000,000. After approximately two and a half years working in the five-star hotel, Windah felt he was being passed over for promotion and decided that he did not want to remain in the same position any longer, so he resigned.<ref name="Kumparan"/><ref name="blitsnews"/> He met his girlfriend Sesilia Agnes while still working at the hotel.<ref name="Dunia Games"/>
                
                Windah decided working at a hotel was not where he wanted to be, he saw his future as a professional YouTuber, particularly in the [[gamer|gaming category]].<ref name="Kumparan"/>
                
                ===Personal life===
                When Windah was in his [[freshman year]] in [[middle school]], he experienced bullying by his schoolmates, this could have been due to his tall, lanky stature. He did not tell his parents because he felt ashamed to admit that others saw him this way. The bullying continued into high school which is why he decided to quit in second grade.<ref name="blitsnews"/>
                
                ==Career==
                Windah had been fond of playing video games since childhood. The first [[game console|console]] he played on was a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Since beginning elementary school, Windah was fond of his [[PlayStation 1]] (PSX) and the RPG game [[Suikoden II]].<ref name="Kumparan"/><ref name="blitsnews"/>
                
                Windah's interest in gaming continued into adulthood, although at that time he was working as a waiter in a five-star hotel. After he saw the success of YouTubers like [[:id:MiawAug|MiawAug]], he felt he had the potential to become a professional Gaming YouTuber and decided to resign from the hotel.<ref name="Kuyou">{{cite news |last=Puspitasari |first=Nisa |date=4 February 2021 |title=Biodata Windah Basudara, Lengkap Umur dan Agama, Gamer Banyak Genre Favorit Milenial dan Gen Z |language=id |trans-title=Windah Basudara Biodata, Complete Age and Religion, Gamers Many Millennials and Gen Z Favorite Genres |publisher=Kuyou |url=https://kuyou.id/homepage/read/18769/biodata-windah-basudara-lengkap-umur-dan-agama-gamer-banyak-genre-favorit-milenial-dan-gen-z |access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref> To begin his new career, he bought an [[Asus#Republic of Gamers (ROG)|Asus ROG]] laptop for IDR 13,000,000, but he was still nervous about starting his own channel, so he planned to invite two of his siblings, Caroline and Vincent, so each could start their own channel at the same time. However, because they were still at school, he had no choice but to build a channel by himself. He created the channel Windah Basudara, taken from the [[family name]] Windah, and ''basudara'', which means 'siblings' in [[Manado Malay|Manado language]].<ref name="Kumparan"/><ref name="blitsnews"/><ref name="Dunia Games"/> Despite being named ''basudara'', his siblings have never featured in the channel. His online alias is a [[misnomer]] as the term ''basudara'' refers to Windah and his siblings.
                
                ===YouTube career===
                Windah Basudara started his YouTube career on 29 Dec 2018. To kick-off his YouTuber career, the laptop which Windah had paid Rp. 13&nbsp;million for a month earlier was damaged, so it had to be taken in for repair.<ref name="Kumparan"/> Now desperate, he tried a return to hotel work, but each application was rejected.<ref name="Dunia Games"/> Windah confided in his mother, who offered him a loan so he could buy a new [[Personal computer|PC]]. He revealed that once he had difficulties getting viewers, so he began adding spam links in chats on several social media platforms such as [[Facebook]], [[Google+]] and [[Line (software)|Line Square]].<ref name="Viewers">{{cite news |last=Syahdan |first=Oleh |date=24 May 2021 |title=Windah Basudara Shares Hardship of Getting Viewers Before His Breakthrough |publisher=Dunia Games |agency=Telkomsel |url=https://duniagames.co.id/discover/article/windah-basudara-curhat-soal-sulitnya-mendapatkan-penonton/en |access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref>
